# Equality
# In R booleans, strings, and numbers can be compared. 
# Operators: 
# == 
# !=
# < 
# >
# Vector to vector comparison is possible.
# 
# Comparison of logicals
TRUE == FALSE # FALSE is not equal to TRUE

# Comparison of numerics
-6 * 14 != 17 - 101 # This results in FALSE because they are both equal

# Comparison of character strings
"useR" == "user" # This results in FALSE

# Compare a logical with a numeric
TRUE == 1 # This results in TRUE

# R Logical operators
# & is a logical AND
# | is a logical OR
# ! is a logical not

# && returns logical result of the first element of each element whereas & performs the logical result on each element

# In order to compare ranges of elements, compare using the following notation:
# 3 < x | x < 10 
# The equation above will compare if x is between 3 and 10


# If condition
# If-else syntax:
# if (statement) { } else if (condition) { } else { }

# While loops
# while (condition) { code }
# breaks will exit the while loop completely.

# For loops
# for (p in primes) { print(p)} # this will print the element in primes
# for (i in 1:length(primes)) { print(primes[[i]])} # this will print the element in primes
