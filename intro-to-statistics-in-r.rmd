# Measure of spread
# seq(): creates a sequence of numbers 

# quantile(): calcultes the quantiles of a spread of numbers
# Define how split the quantiles using probs = c(0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1)
# Example
# quantile(food_consumption$co2_emission, probs = c(0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1))
# quantile(food_consumption$co2_emission, seq(0,1,.1)) # sequence will create the quantiles here;

# Variance
# var(): this function is used to calculate the variance

# Standard deviation
# sd(): this function is used to calculate the standard deviation 

# The IQR is calculated by the first and third quartile ranges
# Calculate total co2_emission per country: emissions_by_country

# Example
# emissions_by_country <- food_consumption %>%
#  group_by(country) %>%
#  summarize(total_emission = sum(co2_emission))

# Compute the first and third quartiles and IQR of total_emission
# q3 <- quantile(emissions_by_country$total_emission, 0.75)
# q1 <- quantile(emissions_by_country$total_emission, 0.25)
# iqr <- q3 - q1

# sample
# sample_n(1) : this will choose 1 sample randomly; it is used with a pipe; 
# Example use:
# data %>% sample_n(1)

# set_seed(5) will set the seed so the same data will be pulled everytime from the data;
# sampling without replacement; taking a sample without replacing the sample in the dataset;

# sample with replacement:
# sample_n(5, replace = TRUE)
